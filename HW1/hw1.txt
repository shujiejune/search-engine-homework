The Ask search engine is completely different from Google. The average percent overlap is 0.0%, and the average Spearman coefficient is 0.0 over all 100 queries in Set 3, i.e. not a single URL (article result) returned by Ask matches any of the top 10 URLs returned by Google. This might be due to Ask having laid too much weight on contents from its own network websites, rather than indexing and searching from the entire web.
